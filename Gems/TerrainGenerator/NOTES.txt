- the reason why the current procedurally generated world is not really doing it for me is because there's nothing in it 
- so I do not actually get a feel for things
- I noticed when watching other procedurally generated worlds, the terrain is not actually that complicated
- what made them interesting was the foliage, procedurally generated cities, forrests, mountains, e.t.c 


TODO:
- add basic textures for better visualizing.
- add first person controller
- add basic water
- add skybox
